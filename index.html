            <h1>[12/18/2024] Hello this is just something to try :)</h1>
            <p>I wanted to be able to put relavant topics and ideas that i have throughout my days. Its also so I can help myself keep track certain tasks i would like to try. Its also to have some sort of self reminders to do them. Projects are to come soon before i start putting in ideas. Gotta get caught up before you can go forward!!! </p>
